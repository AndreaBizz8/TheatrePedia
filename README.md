# TheatrePedia
Website created for theatre-goers in which all details theatre related can be found, instead of looking in hundreds of different tools.

Hi all, this website has been created for my final year project. It has taken in consideration something like 20 to 30 different theatre website.
Understanding what where the information needed it has been extremely challenging, but luckily the creation of the database has come along with it.

I know the design is not the best, and it is not responsive, but the main object of the project was the creation of the database that, anyway will stay private.

If you have any ideas on how my webapplication could be improved, I am more than happy to hear from you and have a chat.

If you have any question, just ask.
